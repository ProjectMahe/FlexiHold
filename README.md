📱 Mobile Phone Stand — FreeCAD Project
A lightweight, durable, and ergonomic phone stand designed using FreeCAD, aimed at improving accessibility and ease-of-use for individuals with physical limitations or mobility impairments.

📌 Inspiration
Many people with limited motor skills struggle to hold or position mobile devices for extended periods — whether for video calls, online learning, or daily communication. This project was inspired by the need for a stable, hands-free mobile support tool that is easy to manufacture and adapt using 3D modeling and printing.

🔧 What it does
Securely holds smartphones of different sizes in both portrait and landscape orientation

Features an ergonomic tilt angle for optimal screen visibility

Compact and portable with an easy-to-print, support-free structure

Ideal for desks, wheelchairs, and bedsides

🛠️ How we built it
Sketching & Planning: We started by outlining dimensions compatible with most phones.

Modeling in FreeCAD:

Base and backrest modeled using Part Design Workbench

Fillets added for comfort and aesthetics

Chamfers used for better print stability

Exporting for 3D Print:

Converted .FCStd model into .STL format for slicing

🚧 Challenges we ran into
Ensuring correct phone balance across devices

Designing without the need for support material during 3D printing

Making it strong yet using minimal filament

🎉 Accomplishments we're proud of
Designed a useful and adaptable accessibility solution

Achieved a print-ready, support-free CAD model

Completed the project within the hackathon timeline

📚 What we learned
Best practices in FreeCAD modeling

Importance of design thinking in assistive technologies

How minor design changes affect balance and stability

🔜 What's next for Mobile Phone Stand
Add adjustable angles using pivot joints

Create a folding version for easy travel

Explore mounting options for wheelchairs and walls

🧰 Built with
